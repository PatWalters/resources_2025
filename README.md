## Machine Learning in Drug Discovery Resources 2025

### Datasets

You'll notice the conspicuous absence of two widely used datasets, [MoleculeNet](https://moleculenet.org/) and the [Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC)](https://tdcommons.ai/) from this list.  Both of these datasets are highly flawed and should not be used.  For more on the reasons why, please
consult this [blog post](https://practicalcheminformatics.blogspot.com/2023/08/we-need-better-benchmarks-for-machine.html). 

[OpenADMET](https://openadmet.org) seeks to proactively characterize the chemical space accessible to
ADMET-associated proteins (“anti-targets”). By applying recent advances in experimental and computational techniques, a
comprehensive open library of experimental and structural datasets will be generated. It's early days for OpenADMET, but
knowing the folks involved, I'm highly optimistic. 

[AIRCHECK](https://aircheck.ai) is a platform that provides access to a large collection of high-quality datasets for drug discovery and
development. The datasets are curated from various sources and are available in a standardized format. The current
focus appears to be on DNA encoded library (DEL) data.

[Polaris](https://polarishub.io) aims is to improve the state of benchmarking so ML can have a greater impact on real-world drug discovery
scenarios. To start, Polaris hopes to provide a single source of truth that aggregates and provides simple access to
datasets & benchmarks.

[PLINDER](https://plinder.sh) is an academic-industry collaboration to collect and organize protein-ligand interaction data. The effort is
driven by VantAI, NVIDIA, the Computational Structural Biology group at the University of Basel & SIB Swiss Institute
of Bioinformatics (co-organizers of CASP), and MIT. PLINDER aims to provide a gold standard dataset and evaluations
to push the field of computational protein-ligand interactions prediction forward.

### Blogs

[Eric J Ma's Website](https://ericmjl.github.io/)
Eric's blog provides an excellent introduction to the application of cutting edge informatics in drug discovery.

[Oxford Protein Informatics Group (OPIG)](https://www.blopig.com/blog)
This blog contains a lot of great [Bio|Chem]informatics content, chock full of code. 

[Charlie’s Substack](https://harrisbio.substack.com/)
Charlie Harris writes about applications of AI in drug discovery. Most recently, his posts have focused on efforts
to reproduce AlphaFold3.

[Mogan Thomas' Cheminformatics Blog](https://cheminformantics.blogspot.com/)
This one is new, but based on the first post, it looks promising. 

[Jon Swain's Blog](https://jonswain.github.io/)
Jon Swain, a second generation Cheinformatics blogger, has great set of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating key concepts. 

[Practical Cheminformatics](https://practicalcheminformatics.blogspot.com/)
This is a blog where I post once a month or so. These posts typically contain code that demonstrates various aspects
of cheminformatics; clustering, machine learning, data visualization, etc. I occasionally throw in posts containing
opinions on things like AI and getting a job.

[Is Life Worth Living](https://iwatobipen.wordpress.com/)
A great blog from Iwatobipen (aka pen), whose posts are
chock full of great code examples. Pen always seems to be up on the latest methods and posts interesting examples on a
variety of topics ranging from quantum chemistry to machine learning.

[The RDKit Blog](http://rdkit.blogspot.com/)
Greg Landrum is the primary contributor to, and BDFL, of the RDKit. In
addition to the latest and greatest features in the RDKit, Greg's posts also touch on a number of key issues in
Cheminformatics, such as dealing with unbalanced datasets and the impact of fingerprint folding on similarity searching.

[Models to molecules](https://driesvr.github.io/)
A new blog by Dries Van Rompaey that seems to be off to a great start. 

### Tutorials

[Practical Cheminformatics Tutorials](https://github.com/PatWalters/practical_cheminformatics_tutorials)
This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks that I put together to demonstrate various aspects of cheminformatics and
machine learning. The notebooks demonstrate a range of topics from cheminformatics basics to more advanced
machine learning. The tutorials all use open source software and can run on Google Colab without installing software
locally. .

[TeachOpenCADD](https://github.com/volkamerlab/TeachOpenCADD)
A great set of tutorials from Andrea Volkamer's group that use Open Source software to teach Computer-Aided Drug Design concepts including molecular similarity, applications of machine learning, and pharmacophore analysis.

[The RDKit Cookbook](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Cookbook.html)
A terrific resource that provides "recipes" for a number of common tasks.

[Vina Colab Tutorials](https://autodock-vina.readthedocs.io/en/latest/colab_examples.html)
A set of tutorials showing how to run Autodock Vina, and the associated protein and ligand setup utilities on Google Colab.
